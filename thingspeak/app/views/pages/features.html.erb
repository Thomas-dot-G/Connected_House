<div class="section_header_reverse">All-purpose Data Storage and Retrieval</div>
<p>You use ThingSpeak to <em>Send</em> and <em>Receive</em> &quot;data&quot; via simple HTTP requests, much like going to a web page and filling out a form.  Data can be from anything -- <em>Blood Sugar Levels</em> measured by a glucose meter, <em>Server Usage and Uptime</em> reported by servers, or <em>Location Info</em> from a mobile phone. Once the data is in ThingSpeak, you can build applications that retrieve the data, use the data for process decision making, and reporting.</p>
<p>Data is stored in a ThingSpeak Channel. Each  channel allows you to store up to 8 fields of data up to 255 alphanumeric characters; 4 dedicated location fields for <em>Location Description</em>, <em>Latitude</em>, <em>Longitude</em>, and <em>Elevation</em>; Status Update to augment the data; and a Time Date Stamp to time code each piece of incoming data.</p>
<div class="section_header_reverse">Data Importing</div>
<p>Do you already have a bunch of data collected from data acquisition devices, server logs, or sensors? Then you can use the ThingSpeak Importer to bring in your existing data and leverage the ThingSpeak API and Charts to share with and connect to applications instantly.</p>
<div class="section_header_reverse">Dynamic Charting</div>
<p>When you need to visualize your data, ThingSpeak has dynamic charts and an API to make customizations. The charts are perfect for displaying sensor data  over time and finding some meaning behind the data. ThingSpeak Charts work on all desktop browsers, iPhones, and Android devices by using JavaScript instead of Flash. The chart types supported are <em>Line</em>, <em>Bar</em>, <em>Column</em>, and <em>Step</em>. You can set colors, sizing, and labels to allow the charts to fit perfectly into your web page or web application.</p>
<div class="section_header_reverse">Data Processing</div>
<p>When pulling data out of ThingSpeak, you can process the data to get it ready for your application. You can also filter the data by setting minimum and maximum value thresholds. Processing options include time scaling, summing, averaging, and median.</p>
<div class="section_header_reverse">Integration with Twitter</div>
<p>Often enough you will find times where you want to share significant data across social networks like Twitter. You can have your garage door Tweet,
  &quot;You left your garage door open&quot; or have your house, say &quot;Today's Power Use was 6150 watts.&quot; The ThingSpeak API has Twitter baked in, so you can send status updates to Twitter along with storing your data in a ThingSpeak Channel at the same time.          </p>
<div class="section_header_reverse">Fully Localized</div>
<p>ThingSpeak supports over 40 time zones and time offsets for locations that support Day Light Savings. When charts and data are presented to users, we format times and dates using  the viewer's time zone. The user interface for ThingSpeak currently supports English and Brazilian Portuguese languages automatically, but the localization <a href="https://github.com/iobridge/thingspeak/blob/master/config/locales/en.yml" title="GitHub Localization file for ThingSpeak.">file</a> is available for translation into other languages. ThingSpeak numerical data  supports commas used as decimals, for example, it's getting 38,2 degrees in here, for our friends in Brazil and many other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark#Countries_using_Arabic_numerals_with_decimal_comma" title="Countries using Arabic numerals with decimal comma" target="_blank">countries</a>.</p>
<div class="section_header_reverse">Privacy Options for  Open Data</div>
<p>We respect your privacy. You can choose to make your data public or private. Over 95% of ThingSpeak Channels are private meaning that the data is not publicly accessible without API keys and user authentication. You can control who has access to your data and build applications that are open to those that you choose. We don't sell your data to third-parties. You can even run ThingSpeak on a private network at your facility or home and build tightly secured applications for your organization's needs.</p>
<div class="section_header_reverse">Open Source for Open Source</div>

# Connected_House

OpenSource Project to allow anyone to use probes to monitor things.
- Documentation on how to create (or where to buy) the probes will be given here soon.
- A web interface will be provided for you to use to have a nice experience with viewing your data. 
- The code for this interface (and server) will also be given in case you want to have your own server running.

The probes will run thanks to Moteinos. But as the code is usable for Arduino, you can also use them if a radio module is added.
